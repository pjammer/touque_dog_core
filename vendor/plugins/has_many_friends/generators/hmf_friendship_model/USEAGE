Description:
    hmf_friendship_generator will create a model and migration for a 
    self-referencial friends system. Currently, you MUST pass the model
    name as 'Friendship'. This may change in the future. 
    
    This generator will also produce unit tests and fixtures. To make
    the best tests possible, the fixtures will be looking for at least
    3 users from your user model. Feel free to edit this to your liking.


Example:
    ./script/generate friendship_model Friendship

    This will create a model, migration, unit_test and fixture:
        Model:      app/models/friendship.rb
        Test:       test/unit/friendship_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/friendships.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_friendships.rb
        
    You should then run "rake db:migrate".
