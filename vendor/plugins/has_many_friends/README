HasManyFriends - Steve Ehrenberg - http://dnite.org
===================================================
has_many_friends is a plugin based off of the friendship_plugin that can be found
here (http://svn.webwideconsulting.com/svn/friendship_plugin/). This version of the
plugin adds some features I wanted as well as eliminates the need for 2 friendship
rows created in the table. The goal is to make it relatively seamless for anyone to
create a fully functional friends system for their application.


Setup
=====
To use this plugin, you will first need to install it. This can be done quite simply
with the following command.

   script/plugin install http://svn.dnite.org/has_many_friends

We'll need to generate the model and migration for your friendship table.

   script/generate hmf_friendship_model Friendship
   rake db:migrate
   
If you will be running tests, you may need to prepare your test database again.

   rake db:test:prepare

You should be just about set! All you need to do is add the following method
to your User model.

   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many_friends
     # the rest of your user model ...
     # ...
   end


Usage
=====
After the plugin is installed. All of these super cool methods will be attached to 
any user.

These methods are the actual associations. They return what you'd expect.
   user.friends_for_me
   user.friends_by_me
   user.pending_friends_for_me
   user.pending_friends_by_me

Again, these will return what you would expect them to return.
   user.friends
   user.pending_friends
   user.pending_or_accepted_friends

## The following 3 methods were changed as of revision 8. They have been listed here
## as these methods, but for some reason, i never changed their names in the actual
## plugin file. If your using a pre-8 version and things broke for you, use the new
## method names in your application. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Returns true if user is friends with friend.
   user.is_friends_with? friend
   user.is_pending_friends_with? friend
   user.is_friends_or_pending_with? friend

Creates, deletes or updates friendship requests.
   user.request_friendship_with friend
   user.delete_friendship_with friend
   user.accept_friendship_with friend

Bypass the request and just make a friend.
   user.become_friends_with! friend

Returns the friendship object (good for looking up extra attributes about
the friendship, like when it was accepted and such.
   user.friendship friend
